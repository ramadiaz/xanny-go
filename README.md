## About The Project

**Xanny Go Template** is a robust and scalable boilerplate for building RESTful APIs using Go (Golang). Designed with best practices and modern development in mind, this template serves as a starting point for backend projects, enabling developers to quickly set up and customize their API solutions.

### Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Organized with a clean directory structure, separating concerns for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Layered Approach**: Implements the handler-service-repository pattern to keep business logic, data access, and API handling separate.
- **Gin Framework**: Leverages the powerful and minimalist Gin framework for efficient request handling and routing.
- **ORM Support**: Uses GORM for database interactions, providing an easy and familiar way to handle models and migrations.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration management to simplify environment-specific settings using Viper.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanism using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless and secure user sessions.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Centralized error management to ensure consistent and informative API responses.
- **Auto-Migrations**: Automated database migrations using a dedicated migration script for seamless schema updates.
- **Makefile Automation**: Includes a Makefile for common tasks such as running the application, building binaries, and executing migrations.

### Why Use Xanny Go Template?

This template is ideal for developers looking for a ready-to-use, yet flexible structure for their Go backend projects. By providing essential features out-of-the-box, it allows you to focus on building core functionalities without worrying about boilerplate code.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of Xanny Go Template up and running on your machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Go (Golang)**: Version 1.22.1 or higher. You can download it from [Go's official website](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **Database**: You need a running instance of a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MSSQL). Make sure to set up the database and configure the connection.
- **Make**: Optionally, you can install [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for automating tasks like building, running migrations, etc.

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open your terminal and clone the project to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramadiaz/xanny-go-template.git
   cd xanny-go-template
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure your Go modules are set up and all dependencies are installed.

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project. Here's an example:

   ```bash
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_USER=your-username
   DB_PASSWORD=your-password
   DB_NAME=xanny_db
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
   ```

   Replace the values with your own database connection details and secret key.

4. **Run database migrations**:
   The template comes with a migration script to set up the necessary database tables. You can run it using the following command:

   ```bash
   make migrate
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   To start the application, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

   This will start the server, and the API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### Optional: Building the Application

If you'd like to build the application binary for production use, you can run:

```bash
make build
```

This will compile the application into a binary located in the `bin/` folder. You can then execute the binary directly.

## Usage

Once you have set up the project and run the application, you can access the default API endpoint to verify that the server is working correctly.

### Default API Endpoint

By default, the API exposes a single endpoint:

- **GET** `/api/ping`

This endpoint will return a simple JSON response with a status of 200 and a message of "pong."

#### Example Request

```bash
curl http://localhost:<PORT>/api/ping
```

Replace `<PORT>` with the port number specified in your `.env` file.

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "message": "pong"
}
```

This response indicates that the server is up and running. You can modify this route or add more routes as needed to expand the functionality of the API.

### Customizing the Server Port

To customize the port, change the `PORT` value in the `.env` file:

```bash
PORT=your-desired-port
```

Then, restart the application with:

```bash
make run
```

The API will now be accessible at `http://localhost:<your-desired-port>/api/ping`.
